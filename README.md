# London Ruby Unconference 2018
Welcome to the London Ruby Unconference 2018!

## Unconference Theme
The love for Ruby and all things related to Ruby (Elixir, Crystal) and current trends.

## What is an Unconference anyway?
An 'unconference' is a gathering which aims to provide an open and creative conversation on a topic of mutual interest to surface their collective knowledge, share ideas and insights, and gain a deeper understanding of the subject and the issues involved. It is unlike a normal conference is that there is no pre-planned agenda, no central organization, no fixed speakers, and no eye-watering price tag!

## How does it work?
But surely that'll never work?! Well, you might think that, but there are already a very long list of very successful unconferences - in London we have XP Day and the LJC Open Conference, and outside London the SoCraTes (un)conference, to name but three. Somewhat more famous examples include [BarCamp](http://barcamp.org/w/page/402984/FrontPage) (worldwide) and even [UKGovCamp!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kqThn6yeBJA)

### The rules of Unconference
There aren't many rules.
* You _must_ be nice to everyone. Yes, everyone. Even if you don't agree with them!
* There are no presenters at Unconference, only participants
* There are no spectators at Unconference, only participants
* Everyone is here to learn, and to contribute
* You _must_ not use the unconference to try and sell products or recruit people, this is an open space for people to learn together, not a sales presentation or a founder-dating event

### Un-rules, or expected behaviours
These aren't rules, per se, but they are things that you should expect:
* _Expect_ to talk about Unconference outside of the event
* _Expect_ to blog/tweet/post on social media about Unconference
* The 'law of two feet' applies: if you're not getting or adding value at a session, _expect_ to get up and walk to a different one
* _Expect_ to have your point-of-view challenged (respectfully)
* _Expect_ to have to explain the 'why', and to talk about the meta around things that you may take for granted in your usual workplace/community

## What will we talk about?
We expect to have at least 14 sessions and 6 hands-on workshops.

Workshops are 2 hours hands-on sessions lead by an experienced developer.

## Do you have a code of conduct?

### Code of conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.

*tl;dr: Be nice or go home*

Our organisers are dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, age or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of conference participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks. Conference participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the conference without a refund at the discretion of the conference organisers.

Harassment includes verbal comments that reinforce social structures of domination, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the conference organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of conference staff immediately; you can identify them by their ? t-shirts and "Volunteer" or "Organiser" badges. Conference staff may also be contacted by email (unconference@codescrum.com).

Conference staff will be happy to help participants contact venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the conference. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at all conference venues and conference-related social events.
